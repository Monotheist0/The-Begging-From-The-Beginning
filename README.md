## üöÄ How to Run the Game Locally

To run "The Begging: From the Beginning" on your local machine, you'll need a web server environment that supports PHP, like XAMPP.

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * Install XAMPP (or a similar package like WAMP for Windows, MAMP for Mac). Make sure Apache and PHP are running. You can download XAMPP from [apachefriends.org](https://www.apachefriends.org/).

2.  **Setup Instructions:**
    * **Clone or Download:**
        * If you have Git: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git`
        * Alternatively, download the project ZIP from GitHub and extract it.
    * **Place Project Folder:** Move the entire project folder (e.g., `The-Begging-From-The-Beginning`) into your XAMPP `htdocs` directory.
        * On Windows, this is usually `C:\xampp\htdocs\`
        * On macOS, this is usually `/Applications/XAMPP/htdocs/`
    * **Start XAMPP:** Open the XAMPP Control Panel and start the **Apache** module. (MySQL is not strictly required for this game's current features, but it's okay if it's running).
    * **Access the Game:** Open your web browser and navigate to:
        `http://localhost/your-project-folder-name/`
        (e.g., `http://localhost/The-Begging-From-The-Beginning/`)

    The game should now load and be playable! Your progress will be saved using PHP sessions on your local server.
